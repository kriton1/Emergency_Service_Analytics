<b>Emergency Service Analysis</b></br>
<p></p>
The Project aims to generate insights from an ambulance service where a patient calls 555. A staff member will receive the call (Time Recorded) </br>and assign a despatch code, once the despatch code has been assigned. </br>The Ambulance will then leave the station (Time Recorded). The Ambulance will then arrive at the patient's house (Time Recorded).</br> The Ambulance will then arrive at the Hospital (Time Recorded). Then there is one final Timestamp for when the job is complete.</br>
